Metamorphic Viruses Analysis and Detection by "DFA-Detection" Algorithm

There are many similarities with biological viruses, computer viruses. Like biological viruses, computer viruses proliferate because they are unexpected destruction, the most advanced of these viruses, and viruses are polymorphism. These viruses have the power to change the shape of DNA, like the change. Polymorphism is most similar to viruses and biological viruses having the ability to change shape in different situations can make progress. These viruses are the biggest problem with the virus. Different methods for virus detection and removal methods that these viruses are being developed. These improvements are advanced polymorphism with the occurrence of new viruses. In this project the author has devised a new method we want to understand.
